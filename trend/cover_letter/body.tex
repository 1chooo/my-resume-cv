This is Hugo ChunHo Lin, a 4th-year student at 
National Central University, fueled by a sincere passion for the field of Software Engineering ðŸ’».
I am reaching out to express my keen interest in 
the \textbf{"Software Development and Test Intern"} position at 
\company. The primary aim of this letter is to 
underscore my qualifications as a strong candidate 
for \company and convey my expectations regarding 
the company. I firmly believe that my skills and 
experiences closely align with the prerequisites 
for this role.

Currently, I am working as a Cloud Engineer Intern 
at eCloudValley, with a focus on building 
hybrid cloud application architectures using 
AWS and Azure. Additionally, I am preparing 
for the SSA certification. 
During the summer between my third and 
fourth year of university, I am software enginner intern at Pegatron. 
During this time, I developed a software project 
called "Smart Robot, Smart World", which 
involved controlling a virtual robotic arm 
through text and voice commands. I presented 
this project to the CTO and received 
second place in a project competition. 
Subsequently, I served as an AWS Campus Ambassador 
during the forth year, where I promoted 
cloud computing to over 700+ attendees and 
developed a Serverless Line Bot using AWS 
services.

Throughout my academic journey, I continuously 
enhanced my software development skills. 
Particularly in my senior year, I delved 
into web application development and self-taught 
the GO language. I also audited the 
graduate course "The Attack and Defense of Computers," 
where I learned about pwn and web-related 
attacks and defenses such as stack overflow 
and command injection. Additionally, 
I developed a TCP protocol anonymous 
chatroom using sockets during my spare time.


As an intern, I am not only committed to fully engaging but also to maintaining motivation for learning even after the internship. I am eager to learn from experienced professionals, work collaboratively with team members, and contribute ideas to meaningful projects. I am self-disciplined, a quick learner, detail-oriented, and can work effectively under pressure.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and learn more about the position.
