# 2024 TECH FRESH Spring Class - Backend

我是林群賀，我將用以下篇幅闡述為什麼我為什麼我該加入 LINE Developers。

我學習程式相關的技能到目前為止僅有兩年，這兩年裡我花了大量課外時間自學，我會看最新的技術文章，有任何人在社交軟體更新軟體技術，我都會點進去，看了新學的技術，我就會想盡辦法用進我的專案，甚至會把過去的專案拿來套用最新的技術，因此我保持每天進步、學習。

我也樂於像他人分享我學習到的技術，在此同時又喜歡述說著我的故事，因此我加入了 AWS 校園大使，我想要把自身的能力以及經歷轉換成故事鼓勵更多人，而我也正在此道路上。

過去的在 Pegatron 實習經驗中，我也累積了很多職涯的體驗，利用 Scrum 敏捷開發安排工作內容，領導實習專案團隊一起統籌專案以及組織會議內容，將自身在 GitHub 的經驗用在開發流程，開發了 LLM 以直接語音操控模擬工廠手臂運行，並在最後與技術長以及其他資深工程師 Demo 的舞台獲得了專案第二名的成果。

最後我想讓我在和碩實習以及我在 AWS 認識的好伙伴們對我的評價來呼應我的獨特，遇到的夥伴最常問我的就是「我怎麼學這麼快又能學這麼多？」我想我也還在找尋答案，讓自己更強，但我知道我正在做我熱愛的事，也正在續寫專屬於我的故事，我想參與 LINE 的實習計畫，繼續譜出我的樂章。

This is Hugo ChunHo Lin, a senior majoring in Atmospheric Science, and actively working towards a minor in Computer Science at National Central University. I am reaching out to express my keen interest in the ”2024 TECH FRESH Spring Class - Backend” position at LINE. The primary aim of this letter is to underscore my qualifications as a strong candidate for LINE and convey my expectations regarding the company. I firmly believe that my skills and experiences closely align with the prerequisites for this role.

I have been learning programming-related skills for just two years. During these two years, I have dedicated a significant amount of my after-school time to self-study. I keep up with the latest technology articles and whenever anyone posts updates on software technology in social platforms, I dive into it. After learning new techniques, I always strive to incorporate them into my projects. I even try to apply the latest technology to my past projects. As a result, I maintain a daily commitment to learning and improving.

I am also passionate about sharing what I've learned with others, while also enjoying telling my own story. That's why I became an AWS Cloud Ambassador. I aim to transform my skills and experiences into inspiring stories to encourage more people on a similar path. I am well on my way in this journey.

During my internship at Pegatron, I have accumulated a wealth of career experiences. I have used Scrum agile development to organize work tasks, led internship project teams in coordinating projects, and managed meeting content. I applied my experience on GitHub to the development process and created LLM, a project that allows direct voice control of a simulated factory arm. It earned the second place at the project demo stage, presented in front of the CTO and other senior engineers.

Lastly, I want to reflect the unique qualities that my internship at Pegatron and the good friends I met at AWS have noted about me. Most often, my peers would ask me, "How do you learn so quickly and acquire so much knowledge?" I believe I am still seeking the answer to that question, constantly striving to improve myself. However, I do know that I am doing what I love and continuing to write my own story. I would like to be a part of LINE's internship program and contribute to my own musical journey.

As an intern, I am eager to learn from "experienced professionals, work collaboratively with team members, and contribute ideas to meaningful projects." I am a self-discipline, quick learner, detail-oriented person, and can work effectively under pressure.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and learn more about the position.
