我的名字是 Hugo ChunHo Lin，目前正就讀 National Central University 大四的學生，我主修的科系是 Atmospheric Science 以及正積極地修習 Computer Science and Information Engineering 的相關課程。我今天要撰寫的目的是為了凸顯自己適合 Tomofun 的原因，以及我對於 Tomofun 的期待。我相信我的能力是非常地契合這份工作。

I am Hugo ChunHo Lin, currently in my senior year at National Central University, majoring in Atmospheric Science, and actively working towards a minor in Computer Science and Information Engineering. I am reaching out to express my keen interest in the "RD Intern - Backend" position at your company, Tomofun. The primary aim of this letter is to underscore my qualifications as a strong candidate for Tomofun and convey my expectations regarding the company. I firmly believe that my skills and experiences closely align with the prerequisites for this role.

目前我正在 AWS Educate 擔任 Technical Support 校園大使的角色，我最主要負責的是了解 AWS 相關的服務，並且開發設計成初學者、對程式有興趣的人都能聽得懂的技術工作坊，最近一場我便會帶領大家透過 Lex 智慧語音助理加上 Lambda 的服務帶大家做聊天機器人導向的遊戲，以帶大家體驗語音助理的好處，也更讓大家認識 AWS 的相關服務，此外我也正計畫著下一場工作坊，我將會使用 AWS 的 Lambda, s3, API Gateway 將服務串接到 LINE BOT 以製作個人的名片，讓大家能夠透過 LINE 在商業場合上與他人順利社交並且進一步認識。我相信上述這些經驗能夠讓我在 Tomofun 的工作上更加得心應手，因為為了準備工作坊，我已經習慣閱讀 AWS 的官方文件，更有著將複雜的科技技術化簡，以跟他人做溝通討論，無論是日常開會又或是文件撰寫都有著非常大的幫助。

Currently, I am serving as a Campus Ambassador for AWS Educate in the role of Technical Support. My primary responsibilities include gaining a comprehensive understanding of AWS services and developing technical workshops that are accessible to beginners and those with an interest in programming. In a recent workshop, I led a session where we utilized Lex, an intelligent voice assistant, in conjunction with Lambda services to create a chatbot-driven game. This experience allowed participants to explore the benefits of voice assistants and gain a better understanding of AWS services.

Furthermore, I am in the process of planning the next workshop, where I will be integrating services such as Lambda, S3, and API Gateway to create a personal business card using LINE BOT. This project aims to enable effective networking and social interaction through LINE in professional settings. I believe that these experiences have prepared me to excel in a role at Tomofun. To prepare for these workshops, I have become accustomed to reading AWS official documentation and simplifying complex technical concepts for effective communication with others. This skill has proven invaluable in various aspects of my work, from daily meetings to document writing.

我在 2023 的暑假也在 Pegatron Corporation 擔任軟體工程實習生，在這段過程中，我不只做出了 Machine Learning 的產品，我更學習到了 Scrum 敏捷的開發流程，我在這份實習內容主要負責 LLM Model 的 training，我的目的是能以對話的方式控制虛擬的機械手臂完成我們指定的任務，因此我將軟體開發的技術帶入專案之中，在兩個月的努力中：By employing Prompt Engineering, I have increased support from 6 to 11 scenarios, a 83% improvement, The model accuracy has increased to 80% and now supports four objects, up from two. 此外開發這項專案的過程中也讓我接觸了 Scrum 我們總共經歷了兩個 sprint 每次開始 sprint 前我都會花費大量時間釐清工作內容，以及把工作差分成半小時到一小時為單位的工作內容，讓我能更好地追蹤工作流程以及更精確地安排每日的工作、會議，有鑒於我在開始 sprint 前已經釐清工作內容，因此如果有突發的狀況發生，我也能發會 Scrum 開發的最大優勢，快速調整我的工作內容，以確保 sprint 的進度能夠順利完成。我相信有了這段 Scrum 的開發經驗能讓我在 Tomofun 擔任 Backend Intern 更加得心應手也更快進入狀況。

In the summer of 2023, I also worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Pegatron Corporation. During this internship, I not only developed machine learning products but also gained valuable experience in Scrum agile development processes. My primary responsibility during this internship was to train an LLM model, enabling virtual robotic arms to be controlled through conversational means to complete specified tasks. I integrated software development techniques into the project, and through two months of dedicated effort, I achieved significant improvements. By implementing Prompt Engineering, I increased support from 6 to 11 scenarios, an 83% enhancement, and the model's accuracy improved to 80%, now accommodating four objects, up from two.

Additionally, the development process of this project introduced me to Scrum. We went through two sprints, and before the start of each sprint, I dedicated substantial time to clarify the work scope and break down tasks into units lasting from half an hour to one hour. This meticulous approach allowed me to better track workflow and make precise daily work and meeting arrangements. Having clarified the work scope before starting each sprint, I could leverage one of Scrum's most significant advantages: the ability to swiftly adjust my tasks in response to unexpected developments, ensuring the smooth progress of the sprint.

I believe that the experience I gained in Scrum development will enable me to excel in the role of Backend Intern at Tomofun and help me quickly adapt to the company's working environment.

最後想要講述我的 side project 經驗，我目前正在開發一個多人的聊天室，我將會使用 Go Language 其目的是為了利用 socket-programming 來實作一個多人的聊天室，這是我第一個 Go Language 的專案，我將會更了解 Go Language 在後端方面的應用，我想趁此專案看出 Go 在多線程的優勢，也趁此機會接觸系統相關的設計。另外我最擅長的程式語言是 Python 我用過 Flask 以及 FastAPI 做後端的開發，其中我開發了兩個 Line Bot 其中一個是為了實現永續的目的，將剩食的概念融入點餐的系統之中，在機器人正式營運的當週，我成功創下了 300 為使用者的成果，並且能夠成功完成店家的商品上架以及顧客的商品購買，為地球盡一份心力，此外我的另外一個 Line Bot 是結合機器學習的影像識別技術，結合至 Line Bot 以鼓勵大眾做到落實回收，我也將這個發想投入 Weather Hackthon 的競賽中獲得了第二名以及永續特別獎的佳績。最後我正用 FastAPI 開發一個學習平台- SIMPLE AI，希望做到讓不會寫程式的人都能學習機器學習，我也將困難的程式部分變成可以和使用者互動的網頁介面。在上述的開發經驗中，我經常使用到 Git 相關的管理工具也用到 GitHub Action 的 CI/CD 技術，也有加入 Docker 的環境佈署測試，所以我相信這些經驗可以讓我在開發流程更為順手。

Lastly, I'd like to share my side project experiences. I'm currently working on developing a multi-user chatroom using the Go Language. The project aims to implement a multi-user chatroom using socket programming. This is my first Go Language project, and I intend to gain a deeper understanding of Go's application in backend development. I hope to leverage this project to explore Go's advantages in multithreading and delve into system-related design.

Additionally, my strongest programming language is Python, and I have used Flask and FastAPI for backend development. Among my projects, I've developed two Line Bots. One was created with the aim of incorporating the concept of reducing food waste into a ordering system for sustainability. In the week the bot officially launched, it successfully attracted 300 users and facilitated product listings for restaurants as well as customer purchases, contributing to sustainability efforts. My other Line Bot combines machine learning image recognition technology to encourage recycling. This idea earned me second place in the Weather Hackathon competition, along with a sustainability special award.

Currently, I am working on a learning platform, "SIMPLE AI," using FastAPI. My goal is to make machine learning accessible to those who do not have programming experience by creating web interfaces that interact with users. Throughout these development experiences, I have frequently utilized Git for version control and management tools and implemented GitHub Action for CI/CD processes. I have also integrated Docker for environment deployment testing. I believe these experiences will greatly enhance my proficiency in the development process.

With the various experiences mentioned above, I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to \textbf{World-Class projects} with brief confidence. As an intern, I am eager to learn from \textbf{\emph{experienced professionals, work collaboratively with team members, and contribute ideas to meaningful projects.}} I am a self-discipline, quick learner, detail-oriented person, and can work effectively under pressure.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and learn more about the position.
